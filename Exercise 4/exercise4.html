    <pre id="myStyle">Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me,
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.
She was lookin' kinda dumb,
With her finger and her thumb,
In the shape, of an L, on her forehead.

Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
Bend to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun,
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.
So much to do, so much to see,
So what's wrong with takin' the backstreets.
You'll never know if you don't go,
You'll never shine if you don't glow...

Hey now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play.
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid.
And all that glitters is gold,
Only shootin' stars break the mold.

It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now wait till you get older
But the media man begs to differ
Judging by the hole in the satelite picture
The ice we skate, is gettin' pretty thin
The water's gettin' warm, so you might as well swim.
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours
That's the way I like it and I never get bored.

Hey now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play.
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid.
And all that glitters is gold,
Only shootin' stars break the mold.

Hey now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play.
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid.
And all that glitters is gold,
Only shootin' stars...

Somebody once asked if I could spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place,
I said yep, what a concept,
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
Bend to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun,
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.
So much to do, so much to see,
So what's wrong with takin' the backstreets.
You'll never know if you don't go,
You'll never shine if you don't glow.

Hey now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play.
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid.
And all that glitters is gold,
Only shootin' stars break the mold.</pre>
